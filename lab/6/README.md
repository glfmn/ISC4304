# Lab 5: Mandelbrot set 1

```bash
$ python2 lab.py
```

Plots the mandelbrot set, and once the figure for the mandelbrot set is closed, plots the time for computing the mandelbrot set against the proportional number of pixels used in the computation to show that the method used has linear time complexity with respect to the number of pixels.
